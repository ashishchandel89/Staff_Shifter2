StaffShifter

StaffShifter is an Android application made to simplify staff handling in schools and institutes.

The idea of this app came from a real situation. A school receptionist in my family had to manage sudden staff absences almost every day. Handling attendance, finding available teachers, calling them one by one, and updating schedules manually was time-consuming and stressful. This app is my attempt to convert that daily problem into a simple digital solution.

StaffShifter focuses mainly on staff rescheduling. When a teacher is absent, the app helps identify which other teachers are free during that lecture slot. Based on availability, the receptionist can quickly select a suitable substitute without checking registers or asking around.

To save time, the app allows direct calling or sending a WhatsApp message to the selected teacher with a single tap. The message content is automatically prepared, so no manual typing is needed.

Along with rescheduling, the app also supports basic attendance tracking and staff record management. The interface is kept clean and simple so it can be used easily even during busy school hours.

Overall, StaffShifter helps reduce manual work, saves time, and makes staff coordination more organized and reliable.
